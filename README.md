# Neural Networks and Evolutionary Computing Workshop

This was part of a workshop organized by the department of computer science of the University of Chile that I was lucky to attend, and of course they sent us the extra material to study the mentioned topics. They are all written in Python using mainly the Pytorch library.

* Workshop 1 corresponds to Neural Networks
* Workshop 2 corresponds to studies of genetic algorithms
* Workshop 3 corresponds to an integration of genetic algorithms to solve neural network problems.

The class was given by Professor Alexandre Bergel (abergel@dcc.uchile.cl)

I hope it serves you
